Simple SIR Infectious Disease Model

Compartmental SIR model for the spread of infectious disease

Compartments are Susceptibles, Infected, and Recovered.

parameters: time, beta (infection rate), gamma (recovery rate)

appropriate initial conditions: time = 360, beta = 1e-06, gamma = 0.01, susceptible at time 0 = 100000, infected at time 0 = 10, recovered at time 0 = 0.
